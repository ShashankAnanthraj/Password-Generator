## Password Generator

# Instructions

The program will ask:a
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge. 


# Hard Version

When you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version. In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:
```
x$d24g*f9
```
And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
